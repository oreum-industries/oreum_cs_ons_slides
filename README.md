## Oreum Case Studies - Lung Cancer Survival Regression `oreum_cs_ons_slides`

Demonstrate Survival Regression Modelling using Bayesian inference and a
Bayesian workflow, specifically using the `pymc` & `arviz` ecosystem.

Here we report a brief overview of a full case study
[`oreum_cs_ons`](https://github.com/oreum-industries/oreum_cs_ons) 
in which we demonstrate an E2E workflow for models of increasing sophistication. 
We evaluate the behaviour and performance of the models throughout the workflows,
including several state-of-the-art methods unavailable to conventional 
max-likelihood / machine-learning models.

We use a complicated, real-world dataset: the NCCTG Lung Cancer Dataset
[`lung`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/survival/cancer.html) from the
[`survival`](https://github.com/therneau/survival) R package via `statsmodels`.
This complicated dataset requires multiple advanced modelling methods to
handle and mitigate bad / messy data.

See comprehensive explanations and deep technical demonstratations of various 
survival models including Accelerated Failure Time and Piecewise Regression Models
