## Oreum Case Studies - ONS Survival Regression `oreum_cs_ons`

Demonstrate Survival Regression Modelling using Bayesian inference and a
Bayesian workflow, specifically using the `pymc` & `arviz` ecosystem.

Here we report a brief overview of a full case study
[`oreum_cs_ons`](https://github.com/oreum-industries/oreum_cs_ons) 
in which we demonstrate an E2E workflow for models of increasing sophistication. 
We evaluate the behaviour and performance of the models throughout the workflows,
including several state-of-the-art methods unavailable to conventional 
max-likelihood / machine-learning models.

We use a complicated, real-world dataset: the
[ONS England & Wales Deaths 2022](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsregisteredinenglandandwalesseriesdrreferencetables))
reference tables.

This dataset requires multiple advanced modelling methods to handle and mitigate
bad / messy data, and in particular a very unusual **right-truncation**.

See comprehensive explanations and deep technical demonstrations of various
survival models in our public project
[**Oreum Survival**](https://github.com/oreum-industries/oreum_survival)
including Accelerated Failure Time and Piecewise Regression Models
